================ TODO ================
- persistent generated brick graph
- test the solver!

================ Done ================
- to classify the bricks:
    regular:
        cuboid
        slope
        circular
        plate
        others
    technic
        beam
        pin
        connectors
        axles
    others
        gears

- to extract those for our task
    to add more information
- remove unnecessary code
- finish the collision and == function
- add more brick types (see bricks defined in gen_super_graph.py) to test the system.
- remove case of connectivity from collision
- add brick volume
